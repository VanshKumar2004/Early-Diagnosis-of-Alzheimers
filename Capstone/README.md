# Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Using MRI Classification

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease using MRI images. The objective is to classify MRI images into different stages of Alzheimer’s using deep learning techniques. The model utilizes **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **Transfer Learning** to enhance predictive accuracy, supporting medical professionals in detecting Alzheimer’s at an early stage.

## Data Source
The MRI datasets were sourced from reputable universities, research labs, and hospitals. This diverse and high-quality dataset ensures the robustness of the model in detecting early signs of the disease.

## Features
- **Preprocessing of MRI Images:** Implemented image normalization and augmentation to improve model generalization.
- **Transfer Learning Approach:** Leveraged a pre-trained deep learning model to handle complex feature extraction from MRI images.
- **Custom CNN Model:** Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch to compare performance with the transfer learning model.
- **Classification of Alzheimer’s Stages:** Classified MRI images into categories such as Early, Moderate, and Severe Alzheimer’s.

## How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing:** MRI images are preprocessed using normalization and augmentation techniques.
2. **Model Training:** Two models were trained:
   - **Custom CNN Model:** A convolutional neural network built from scratch.
   - **Transfer Learning Model:** Fine-tuned using a pre-trained model (e.g., VGG16, ResNet).
3. **Evaluation and Comparison:** Models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The Transfer Learning model outperformed the custom CNN, demonstrating better feature extraction capabilities.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Deep Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras
- **Pre-trained Models:** VGG16
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
- **Data Visualization:** Seaborn, Matplotlib

## Future Improvements
- **Expand the Dataset:** Include additional MRI scans from more sources to improve model generalization and robustness.
- **Implement Explainable AI Techniques:** Use visualization tools like Grad-CAM to highlight which areas of the MRI images the model focuses on when making predictions.
- **Optimize Model Performance:** Experiment with advanced architectures such as EfficientNet or InceptionNet to further boost accuracy.
- **Integrate a User Interface:** Develop a web-based or desktop application to provide a user-friendly interface for uploading MRI images and viewing classification results.
- **Add Real-Time Monitoring:** Integrate real-time monitoring of the model's performance during inference to detect any unexpected behaviors.
